                Web Development...

            <div class="subsection text-small">
                Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network).Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social
                network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may
                include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side
                scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building
                websites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

                For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (web
                developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
                related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
                be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There
                are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
                developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
                while back-end developers deal with the servers.

                Programming Language...
            </div>
            <div class="subsection text-small">
                A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds
                of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

                Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that
                use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the
                invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the
                9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age. Since the early 1800s,
                programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and
                player pianos. The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce
                different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.

                Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year.
                Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to
                perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how
                to achieve it).

                The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and
                semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C
                programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a
                dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic
                language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

                Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and
                systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.Data science
                is related to data mining, deep learning and big data.

                Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning, domain knowledge and
                their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It uses
                techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer
                science, domain knowledge and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as
                a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted
                that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data
                deluge
                Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are
                typically large (see big data). The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and
                presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization. As such, it incorporates skills
                from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization, graphic design, and
                business.Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human-computer
                interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data. In 2015, the American
                Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed
                and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities
